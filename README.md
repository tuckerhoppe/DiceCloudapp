# Overview

I integrated a dice roller app with firebase to get custom created dice options from the cloud.

# Cloud Database

I am using realtime firebase. The structure is pretty simple, There is a different branch for each different di.

# Development Environment

I used swift in xcode.

I also used pods and google firebase.
I also used the SwiftUI and Firebase libraries.

# Future Work
* The integration of the actual realtime database is still very rough. I would like to clean it up.
* Currently I only have it pulling from the chores dice, not any of the other ones. I would like to get the data for all of the other dice.
* I would like to add ability to write to the database and customize from the app.
